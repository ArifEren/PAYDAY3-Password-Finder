# PAYDAY 3 - Password Finder
* A little external program I created using Gamemaker for PAYDAY 3's in game keypads. You input used numbers and program gives all possible password combinations according to how PAYDAY 3 generates its keypad passwords.

* The program is NOT connected to the PAYDAY 3. It is NOT a mod for PAYDAY 3. It is a stand-alone program, it uses Heapâ€™s Algorithm for generating permutations, and it edits the permutation output according to how PAYDAY 3 is designed to generate passwords for keypads.

* The program is made for fun. If you want to try guessing the keypad password, then you can use this program to keep track of every single possible combination.

* You can download PAYDAY3_Password_Finder folder to use the program.
* Gamemaker Studio 2 project can be found in PAYDAY3_Password_Finder_Project folder.
